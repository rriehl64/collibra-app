# Data Assets 508 Compliance Testing Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive checklist for testing the Section 508 compliance and usability of the Data Assets feature in the E-Unify application. The checklist follows WCAG 2.0 Guidelines organized by the four principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.

## Testing Environment Setup

### Required Browsers
- [ ] Chrome (latest version)
- [ ] Firefox (latest version)
- [ ] Safari (latest version)
- [ ] Edge (latest version)

### Required Assistive Technologies
- [ ] NVDA Screen Reader (Windows)
- [ ] VoiceOver (macOS)
- [ ] JAWS (if available)
- [ ] Keyboard only (no mouse)
- [ ] High contrast mode

## 1. Perceivable

### 1.1 Color Contrast
- [ ] Verify all text has sufficient contrast ratio (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
  - [ ] Asset names vs. background
  - [ ] Field labels vs. background
  - [ ] Button text vs. button background
  - [ ] Status indicators and tags
  - [ ] Domain color schemes

### 1.2 Text Alternatives
- [ ] All images have appropriate alt text
- [ ] Icons have text equivalents or aria-labels
- [ ] Status indicators have text descriptions (e.g., certification badges)
- [ ] Visual patterns (like colored indicators) have text equivalents

### 1.3 Adaptable Content
- [ ] Content can be viewed at 200% zoom without loss of functionality
- [ ] Content works in both portrait and landscape orientations
- [ ] Content is readable when high contrast mode is enabled
- [ ] Layout adjusts responsively on different screen sizes

## 2. Operable

### 2.1 Keyboard Accessibility
- [ ] All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Tab order follows a logical sequence
- [ ] Focus is visible and clearly indicates the current active element
- [ ] Card can be focused with Tab key
- [ ] Card can be activated (edit mode) with Enter key
- [ ] Form fields can be navigated with Tab/Shift+Tab
- [ ] Form can be submitted with Ctrl+Enter
- [ ] Form can be cancelled with Escape key
- [ ] No keyboard traps exist in the interface

### 2.2 Focus Management
- [ ] Focus moves to the first form field when entering edit mode
- [ ] Focus returns to the card when exiting edit mode
- [ ] Focus is trapped within the edit form while in edit mode
- [ ] Focus indicators are clearly visible at all times

### 2.3 Input Modalities
- [ ] Large click targets for users with motor control limitations
- [ ] All interactive elements have adequate spacing
- [ ] Touch targets are at least 44x44 pixels

## 3. Understandable

### 3.1 Form Fields and Labels
- [ ] All form fields have visible labels
- [ ] Form fields have proper label associations (via "for" attribute)
- [ ] Required fields are clearly marked
- [ ] Validation errors are clearly indicated and described
- [ ] Instructions are provided for complex fields (e.g., tags input)

### 3.2 Predictable Behavior
- [ ] UI behavior is consistent throughout the application
- [ ] Edit mode is clearly indicated visually and via ARIA
- [ ] Action buttons (Save/Cancel) have consistent positioning and labels
- [ ] Context changes (like entering edit mode) are announced to screen readers

### 3.3 Input Assistance
- [ ] Error messages are clear and provide guidance for correction
- [ ] Required fields are validated before submission
- [ ] Users can review and correct input before submission
- [ ] Input formats are clearly indicated (e.g., date formats)

## 4. Robust

### 4.1 Compatibility
- [ ] HTML is valid and properly nested
- [ ] ARIA attributes are used appropriately
- [ ] Component works with multiple screen readers
- [ ] Interface works with different browser zoom levels (100%, 150%, 200%)

### 4.2 Specific Screen Reader Tests
- [ ] Card announces its purpose and state to screen readers
- [ ] Edit mode is properly announced when activated
- [ ] Form fields announce their labels and any validation errors
- [ ] Loading states are announced appropriately
- [ ] Success/failure of save operations is announced

## Cross-Browser Compatibility

### Visual Consistency
- [ ] Cards display consistently across all browsers
- [ ] Form controls render appropriately in all browsers
- [ ] Color schemes and styles are consistent across browsers
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible in all browsers

### Functional Consistency
- [ ] Edit functionality works in all browsers
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts work in all browsers
- [ ] Form submission works in all browsers
- [ ] Data is saved correctly in all browsers

## Performance Testing

- [ ] Cards render quickly, even with many data assets
- [ ] Edit mode transitions are smooth
- [ ] Save operations provide appropriate feedback
- [ ] Loading indicators appear for operations taking over 300ms

## Reporting Issues

When reporting accessibility issues, please include:

1. The specific component or feature affected
2. The accessibility principle violated (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust)
3. Steps to reproduce the issue
4. Browser and assistive technology used
5. Screenshots or recordings if possible

Submit issues through the project tracking system with the label "Accessibility".
