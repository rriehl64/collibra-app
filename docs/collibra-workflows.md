# Collibra Automation with Workflows

## Overview
Collibra Workflows provide a powerful automation framework that enables organizations to streamline their data governance processes, enforce data policies, and maintain data quality standards. These workflows can automate repetitive tasks, enforce business rules, and ensure consistency across the data governance lifecycle.

## Key Components

### 1. Workflow Types
- **Business Workflows**: Automate business processes like data asset approval, review cycles, and issue management
- **Technical Workflows**: Handle system-level operations like data synchronization, metadata harvesting, and integration tasks
- **Administrative Workflows**: Manage user access, role assignments, and system configurations

### 2. Workflow Building Blocks

#### Triggers
- Schedule-based triggers
- Event-based triggers (e.g., asset creation, modification)
- User-initiated triggers
- API-based triggers

#### Actions
- Asset creation and modification
- Status changes
- Notification sending
- Role and responsibility assignment
- Data quality rule execution
- API calls to external systems

#### Conditions
- Asset attribute checks
- User role verification
- Time-based conditions
- Complex logical expressions

### 3. Common Use Cases

#### Data Stewardship
- Automated asset review cycles
- Data quality issue management
- Steward assignment and notification
- Change approval processes

#### Compliance Management
- GDPR compliance workflows
- Data privacy impact assessments
- Regulatory reporting automation
- Policy enforcement checks

#### Data Quality Management
- Data quality scoring
- Validation workflows
- Issue tracking and resolution
- Quality metric monitoring

## Best Practices

### 1. Design Principles
- Keep workflows modular and reusable
