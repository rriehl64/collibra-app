# Project Charter: USCIS EAD Cycle-Time Reduction Initiative

## 1. Project Title
USCIS EAD Cycle-Time Reduction Initiative

## 2. Purpose and Justification
Improve timeliness and predictability of EAD adjudications by reducing end-to-end cycle time while maintaining quality and compliance. Aligns with USCIS Data Strategy goals and supports OCDO/OPQ priorities to deliver secure, actionable data for decisions.

## 3. Project Objectives
- Reduce median receipt-to-decision cycle time for EADs.
- Reduce tail variability (P90) and bottleneck queue times.
- Increase throughput per adjudicator-day while keeping quality within AQLs.
- Instrument process and establish continuous improvement cadence.

## 4. Background
Cycle times vary across Service Centers; root causes span intake quality, routing, handoffs, and case complexity. This initiative instruments the EAD process and executes targeted improvements.

## 5. Scope
- In Scope: EAD intake-to-decision workflow; KPI instrumentation and dashboards; routing and prioritization experiments; data integration and DQ improvements; governance and documentation.
- Out of Scope: Policy changes requiring external approvals; platform re-platforming; non-EAD benefit processes.

## 6. Key Deliverables and Success Criteria
- KPI dashboard with baselines and targets.
- Lifecycle, governance, and integration artifacts (maps, matrices, DQ rules).
- Monthly impact readouts; risk/issue logs; improvement backlog.
- Success Criteria (examples):
  - Median cycle time: -20% within 6 months
  - P90 cycle time: -25%
  - Bottleneck queue wait time: -30%
  - Rework rate: -15%
  - RFE rate due to intake defects: -10%
  - Decisions per adjudicator-day: +10%
  - OT hours per 1,000 cases: -10%

## 7. Project Milestones and Schedule
- Kickoff, governance setup: Week 1
- Baseline build and instrumentation: Weeks 1–4
- First wave experiments and readout: Weeks 5–12
- Monthly executive reviews; quarterly re-baselines

## 8. Stakeholders and Governance
- Executive Sponsor: CDO / OPQ Director
- Government Leads: OCDO, OPQ, COR/PM
- Operations: Service Center leadership; Adjudication teams
- IT/Data: Case systems owners; Data integration; BI/Analytics
- Privacy/Security: Privacy Office; ISSO
- Cadence: Weekly PM/COR; biweekly ops/IT working session; monthly executive review

## 9. Key Roles and Responsibilities
- Program Manager: delivery, risk, cadence
- Data Lead: KPIs, instrumentation, analytics
- Governance Lead: policies, stewardship, 508 compliance
- Ops Lead: process changes, training, adoption

## 10. Assumptions and Constraints
- Constraints: Section 508 compliance; Privacy/PII safeguards; remote-first; Government-furnished tools; no travel
- Assumptions: Access to case metadata; light telemetry possible; timeboxed experiments; change management support

## 11. Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- Staffing capacity → mitigation: prioritization, surge plan
- Data quality gaps → mitigation: DQ rules, remediation workflow
- Security/privacy constraints → mitigation: privacy-by-design, least privilege, reviews
- Variability in workload → mitigation: dynamic routing; scenario planning

## 12. Budget Summary
High-level operating budget aligned to task order; references period of performance (base + option years + closeout). Detailed financials maintained in contract artifacts.

## 13. Approval Signatures
- Project Sponsor: ____________________  Date: ______
- Government COR/PM: _________________  Date: ______
- Contractor Program Manager: ________  Date: ______
